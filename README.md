# Let's Doodle

To run the game, you have to run both the frontend and the backend at the same time.

To run the frontend, go to `UI/drawingboard` and run command `yarn start` in the terminal. Install all the dependencies you need when pop up.

To run the backend, go to `UI/backend` and run command `python3 app.py` in the terminal. Install all the dependencies you need when pop up.

When both frontend and backend are up, go to `localhost:3000` to play the game.
